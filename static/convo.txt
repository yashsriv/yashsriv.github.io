<Saksham>
Yo people
Especially Kapila
Yash had some ideas about how why Pclub is not up to the mark of sdslabs

<Kunal>
sure
batao

<Saksham>
Basically, the membership in pclub is like, temporary. Unlike rcon, or hackcave, or sdslabs

<Kunal>
agreed

<Saksham>
Is there a workaround? I understand we cannot give so many PoRs easily without enough work for people.
But perhaps senate/gymkhana has a way?

<Kunal>
gensec can ratify people
like he ratifies secys

<Saksham>
Also, we'd need projects for people to work on, and select people if they are self-motivated enough.

<Kunal>
give them a certi

<Saksham>
Haan that'd be a non-coordie post which involves coding but not the admin shit
Perhaps
Something like hackcave would be nice, if there are enough projects/self-motivated people

<Saksham>
i said what i could draw from yash's idea on IRC, sharing here

<Yash>
Oh..I finally realised what makes robocon different from roboclub   / sdslab different from their pclub   ...................
Once you are in the group, you are a member forever... you work till you don't want to work anymore (same for hackcave)...........
with our gymkhana clubs, most secys  feel that they don't owe the club anything if they aren't the cordies.....very few actually continue contributing

<Kunal>
yeah
this problem has been realised several times
but koi solution nahi socha hai as such

<Saksham>
i suggested something upar, didn't it
*i

<Kunal>
I meant
implement nahi kiya hai kab
hi

<Yash>
The projects for people to work on is also very hard.... sdslabs have projects which require
active maintenance and new members are trained for managing the projects and improving them.... most pclub projects are one time. Puppy Love is one of the exceptions.

<Kunal>
So essentially you are suggesting more long term projects
As one of the solutions to the problem

<Yash>
Also.. who approves Team Robocon/ AUV?? Do they have so many members because they aren't part of gymkhana?

<Saksham>
they are now. they're called TEAMS
separate provisions for teams which take part in contests

<Kunal>
Yeah

<Saksham>
i think if you can list down 5-10 different and new projects which can be done as a group, we have a good group coming up.
but we need a critical mass to be able to go anywhere with this

<Kunal>
Only their team leaders are ratified by the senate
Not the complete team
As far as I remember

<Saksham>
yeah, i was ratified by snt council, not senate. as rcon

<Kunal>
We will need people to maintain the student search, pclub website, puppy love, Gymkhana server(s) (when we get it)
What else?

<Saksham>
dashboard has a billion possibilities

<Kunal>
Oh right
Dashboard
I'll prefer if we break the dashboard into modules
And not keep it as a whole
When we talk about its maintenance

<Yash>
its modularised
currently 6 repos ðŸ˜›

<Saksham>
Just the UI is common

<Kunal>
What all modules does it have?

<Yash>
Student Search, Main Login Stuff, Share Auto  Tempo, Schedule Stuff.. I was thinking separate org @saksham or maybe links to each in the main composer repo

<Kunal>
Yeah
To dashboard ke sub modules maintain karna is a good idea
We can add them to the list
Any other thing 
What all do SDS labs maintain /do

<Yash>
Share IITK equivalent stuff... I have that too as an option

<Saksham>
pirated shit ðŸ˜›

<Kunal>
Ye sab ke liye we can keep specialized people

<Kunal>
Not as coordinators or secys
But verified by the gensec

<Saksham>
not necessary. let's have something like hackcave

<Kunal>
What do you mean by something like Hackcave?

<Saksham>
how do you work in hackcave?
i'll quote aj

<Saksham>
"because they learn new things and get to exchange ideas in a peer group that's on similar frequency" - adarshaj
that's a quote

<Kunal>
So?
I didn't get your point

<Saksham>
let's have a group bound together by that
like rcon is

<Kunal>
Yeah
But
Do you want to keep secys/coordies independent of this group
I don't want to

<Saksham>
2nd year only secy position
3rd year coordie/member

<Yash>
that is the point.. rcon doesn't have secys cordies... its just seniority

<Saksham>
member ko thoda cool naam de do
contributor let's say

<Kunal>
Hacker

<Saksham>
coordies will handle financial stuff
everyone will want to be the equivalent of coordie then. how will you decide who to ratify?
hacker is good

<Kunal>
Secys limited rakho
For administrative purposes
Bills
Bookings
Etc type
Hacker ke liye selection tests ho

<Saksham>
3rd year mein?

<Kunal>
Open to all years

<Saksham>
oh

<Kunal>
Maybe 1st year mein
Recruitment test is what my intention is

<Saksham>
yash, discuss with others and chalk out a feasible solution for this?
idea is good
we can even leverage takneek's black box
but that is too early i think

<Kunal>
We can use that

<Saksham>
could be used as a level1 test
there will be more tests at end of 1st year

<Kunal>
Umm, not exactly

<Saksham>
so new joinees can come in too
oh i meant, 1st test. multiple tests rakh lo.

<Kunal>
Ek main test rakho
Usme ek qualifier and and final test

<Yash>
^ or an interview

<Saksham>
test + interview let's say

<Kunal>
Final test ke liye wildcards like Blackbox top 5 teams
FPC top 3 winners
Aisa kuchh

<Yash>
interviews give you a better idea.... sdslabs has 4 hours interview for the 1st year recruitments....
after that its done... member for life

<Saksham>
nice

<Kunal>
And what about people jo uss test mein nahi ho paaye, but want to continue?
And what special will we give to these "hackers"
Last year bhi yahaan tak mein aur pallav aakar atak gaye the
Then we gave up
And what if banda 2nd year mein aakar seekh gaya, and ab banna chahata hai PClub certified hacker

<Saksham>
2nd yearites ke liye interview

<Kunal>
Ye sab kuchh issues hai iss process mein

<Saksham>
we can't let everyone come in
we will end up in the same shithole

<Kunal>
Wahi to baat hai...

<Saksham>
we want them to be able to help each other, and teach each other
they will also take public lectures

<Kunal>
Why not make then teach others

<Saksham>
because of 100 reasons

<Kunal>
*them

<Saksham>
public lectures are shit
and are slow
and can never touch details
and don't give practical experience
hackers are supposed to learn things by hacking.

<Kunal>
But then we aren't promoting programming in general
Which pclub should do

<Saksham>
public lectures don't go down
abhi bhi hain. hote raheinge
coordies ensure that
hackers hack

<Kunal>
I think this hacker stuff should be in parallel to what is currently happening

<Saksham>
that's what i think, both me and yash implied.

<Kunal>
And jo currently ho rha hai, that should be the first priority
Hackers can be a self sustainable group
But others can't learn if we dont teach
Aisa na ho jaaye ki hamara priority shift ho jaaye gradually
And phir pclub stops being what it was meant to do
Increase programming culture in campus
Woh 10 log ko honge Hackers woh to seekhte hi rahenge agar pclub na bhi ho
Kyunki agr woh itne rigorous process se aaye hai to aata hoga kaafi
And na bhi mile pclub ka support to shsyad aagae badh jaaye
But baaki campus junta nahi

<Saksham>
it will still have to conduct contests. which is required to be under snt.
lectures same hi honge
bas we'll have a place to use our funds, and build a repo like roboclub etc
izzat hogi club ki

<Kunal>
Easy to say
Coordinators 3rd year honge
Ek hi cheez par focus kar payenge apart from acads
Not maintaining the club activities and that hacker group

<Saksham>
hacker group is self sustained
coordies will not have to hack on puppylove etc
which is good
their load will be lessened
coordies can focus on taking lectures, and teaching hackers, rather than code themselves

<Kunal>
So coordinators ko hamm essentially administrative stuff par restrict kar denge?

<Saksham>
it is up to them to code
also, yeh bataa, how many coordies coded for pclub this year?

<Kunal>
Why will people be motivated to become a coordinator then

<Saksham>
kara kya hai tune iss year apart from taking lectures and admin stuff?
that's what coordie is for
for passing on knowledge

<Kunal>
And what about hackers?
What are they for?

<Saksham>
code is not top priority. even if i coded, it was non-essential, honestly
coordie should not have had to do that
it took my attention away from lectures

<Kunal>
I want this thing
But clear nahi hoon Exactly kya karega ye group of hackers

<Saksham>
code
sysad
the only new job for coordie is to oversee hacker group admissions and teaching
coordies will not be forced to code / deploy puppy love now
or deploy other stuff
we will be able to have resourceful people as coordies, without compromizing on the coding workforce of pclub

<Kunal>
I get the idea
But mera point samajh
Won't this discourage people to become coordinators
Code karne ko nahi milega
Sirf lectures lene, admin stuff

<Yash>
Plus we currently don't have that much of a workforce...and probably won't ðŸ˜ž

<Kunal>
wahi
jo ye sab soch rahe hai hamm log
all this is assuming ki we have enough people, either skilled or interested
*and

<Saksham>
having 1st years as hackers will increase the workforce
we're still 2 years away from coordies who will hack beside hackers

<Kunal>
but utne 1st year skill log kahan se aayenge

<Saksham>
abhi toh fresher hack-force banaa ke dekho

<Kunal>
and agar woh skilled nahi to kiss basis par selection

<Saksham>
1st years are always dumb. when thrown into rcon, everyone becomes experts
i believe, if rcon can work, this can too

<Kunal>
^I am not sure about this
rcon has a target to achieve at the end of the year
uski functioning alag hai

<Yash>
probably the best we can do is first year recruitment type thing at end of 1st semester
and then training stuff in winters... will just require dedication from existing members
to stay back.... some of the people being trained will have a target -
be proficient enough to work on puppy love, to update student search for next year.. blah blah

<Saksham>
to become coordie
publicize it as a goal
and people will desire it
just like what is done for prezi in the first year
prezi name is enough to make people become prezi
without knowing the job

<Kunal>
but in the 1st place, we wanted that coordie ka kaam alag hai hacker se

<Saksham>
(i've seen freshies like that)
doesn't matter. hackers will be upgraded to secys too

<Kunal>
these targets are not lucretive
but we will still need separate secys for admin stuff
and unn dono ko hamm secy bolenge
to fair nahi hoga

<Saksham>
yash, can you design a nice system in discussion with others? show us a a brief, informal proposal?

<Kunal>
proposal par to baad mein aaye
pehle line of thought to clear ho

<Saksham>
dude, it will save time

<Yash>
no secy would want to become a secy for admin stuff.... veryone knows that...
kisi ka target nahin hota hain ki hum lecture hall book karwayenge.. bahut maza aayega

<Saksham>
LOL. Yeah, that's why, think of something, no?

<Kunal>
and expecting trained hackers to become secys and do admin stuff isn't exactly fair on their part

<Saksham>
2nd year mein hackers will be known as secys.
1st year mein "<insert name>"

<Kunal>
hackers is a better name ðŸ˜›

<Saksham>
3rd year mein "hackers"

<Kunal>
and coordies?

<Saksham>
coordies are hackers with admin and lecture stuff
who get ratified by senate
and who get all admin passes by default ðŸ˜›
and who get to take lectures

<Yash>
for cordie, you give a proper cordie interview.... others just get promoted to hacker

<Saksham>
actually, hackers can take lectures too
and yes, yash is right

<Kunal>
yeah
this is better

<Saksham>
if you don't code enough, you don't get ratified
by gensec, as a hacker

<Kunal>
let's keep levels
as in
agar koi banda wants to join this pclub group in 2nd year for the 1st time

<Saksham>
he will still be secy?

<Kunal>
to usko hamm "trainee" hi bolenge

<Saksham>
NO!

<Kunal>
aisa kuchh

<Saksham>
no one will want to be compared to freshies
and thus, i don't want to call 2nd year hackers as hackers
coz that's what 3rd years will be

<Kunal>
his first year in pclub will be "trainee"
2nd year in pclub will be "secy"
3rd year as "hacker"

<Saksham>
use seniority, like rcon does
:(
personal opinion. i won't enforce

<Kunal>
2nd year members in rcon jo pehli baar rcon aaye
woh kaise treat hote hai?

<Saksham>
they are still senior members
@yash am i right?

<Kunal>
to phir aisa karna hoga ki selection is 2nd year will be much more difficult

<Yash>
yeah... and they are still supposed to know something ...
that's why they are seniors... not because of being seniors

<Saksham>
but this year, selection will have to remain same for 2nd years since we have no "trainee" force

<Kunal>
theek hai
that can be managed for a year
"trainee" banna hai 2nd year mein to easier hai
but if you want to be called secy to mushkil hoga selection process
aisa kuchh?
we will keep this option open for everyone
like application for trainee, secy and hacker
and coordie too

<Yash>
for secy.... you must be qualified enough to be secy that's all.. something like you must have the skills....
maybe you acquired them in an internship during the summers

<Saksham>
no. people may still be worthy of trainee, but may apply for secy and lose out

<Kunal>
and any year ka banda can apply for any post

<Saksham>
you mean, apply for both?

<Kunal>
haan, progressive applications hongi
pehle coordie
then hacker
then secy
then trainee

<Saksham>
so incoming secy team gonna be shitty

<Saksham>
secys automatically become hacker, unless they choose not too. but we may take external hackers via interview

<Kunal>
yes

<Saksham>
which will be very tough

<Kunal>
what about the algo group we have create this year
where does that fit in this model?

<Saksham>
that's a learning group
let it remain
send mail to @all twice a sem about it

<Kunal>
mushkil ho jayega maintain karna

<Saksham>
so new people can join in

<Kunal>
once a sem

<Saksham>
algo coordie maintains it

<Kunal>
pclub coordie will become a very demanding job then

<Saksham>
algo coordie doesn't have to bother about hacker side of the club if he wnats
dev coordie ka kaam hoga voh

<Kunal>
ye thoda weird ho gaya

<Yash>
the hacker group is to ensure that something productive (read deployable and marketable publicly)
comes out of pclub....algo and rest are the usual pclub stuff which will continue....
the problem is dedicated people staying on even in 3rd year under pressure

<Kunal>
sirf dev ke liye itna extensive model banana, thoda ajeeb lagg raha hai
but agar bana hi rahe hai to chill hai
and jo foss wala google group hai
usme learners rakhenge

<Saksham>
foss group will merge with this part i think
foss group doesn't have much right nowSeen by Pallav Agarwal at 00:31
and we have #pclub for ourselves

<Kunal>
haan wahi
non trainee, but interested ke liye foss group
who may choose to apply for secy next time

<Yash>
the problem is - this is essentially something like navya....
which died out in the end.........Why? can you give some reasons?
we need to think about that too....if it dies out in 2 years, then it was useless

<Kunal>
it seems like we are converging at something now
so, yash, talk to others and come up with some writeup (proposal) on this describing the details

<Yash>
lets have a proper discussion with everyone interested in improving the pclub....
aj, other cordies..maybe current secys?? their views might also be nice.
I'll try and condense this into a proper format which can be attached in a mail or shared on #pclub.....

<Kunal>
yash, talk to people individually about this idea
jisse bhi karni ho tujhe, up to you
and then condense them
no need to make more group chats
but umm, I see your point
this is a very people dependent system
log gaye
things will die down
this structure of seniority will help this in becoming long term
so yeah
a formal structure was missing from navya

<Yash>
ok then.. I'll talk with aj, milind, khosla, anyone else who comes to mind and see what I come up with...
Please try not to discuss any further ðŸ˜› ...it'll become hard to track...
saksham just give reasons if you can think of any why navya died out...I want to know the disadvatages of this
if we really don't want to do too much effort on the establishment part, we could revitalise this as navya itself

<Kunal>
how will it be different

<Yash>
on the structure and stuff
I meant navya with structure

<Kunal>
nayva to abhi dead hai ðŸ˜›
bass naam hi baaki hai

<Yash>
its a name known to some... like profs bhi jaante hain... ppk for example

<Kunal>
name same rakhne par soch sakte hai
that is irrelevant for now
it will be either under navya, or pclub directly

<milindl>
"rcon has a target to achieve at the end of the year" yes EXACTLY we need targets if we do this
it won't die out if we have a room and critical mass
let me think of potential issues
on what basis is selection (what will interview be on?

<yashsriv>
secy and hacker interviews are set.... on your ability
for trainee - what are current pclub secy interviews on?

<milindl>
they leverage current skill
but that;s not possible in November
a lot of kids are new to coding
even if a person has potential they can't display it if they've never used it
current secy interviews are after you have laptops + winters to code + ESC101 for both batches
I mean; if a person is interested in coding it is reasonable to expect _some_ effort till April. But till November? Chances are much lower
Given that Midsems tak to anyone doesn;t have a laptop, then you have spectrum udgo antar in quick succession
we need to have 2 interviews OR jan interviews, potentially missing out on winter camp. Winter camp can be exclusively for secys?

<yashsriv>
That is why the later interviews for people still interested.......... Electronics club has a winter school ?? How do they separate out people / is it open to all??

<milindl>
oh
is that enthu based?

<yashsriv>
first 40 students

<milindl>
first come first serve is poor

<yashsriv>
we'll have a better cutoff.... a test
you are not in favour of an interview
but I think we need the winter training...or do you want to make it summer training

<milindl>
agreed, but what sort?
our test then needs to follow a SDS format ?
1 algorithmic task, 1 google-it-yourself-dev task
I'm not sure. The selection test needs to be more intensive

<yashsriv>
ughh..that's why the interview..but if they have no experience hard to do it

<milindl>
yes, but learning quickly is a valuable skill.
Khosla is a potential 'hacker
prototype of a 'hacker'

<adarshaj>
the problem with hackers being part of a system with formal structure is got to do with the 'formal structure' part.
let me first talk about why navya was formed (as per my discussions with early members on irc)
the problem with student gymkhana is that they alienate anyone with low cpi - below 6.5, and usually,
if you are from a non-cs/ee dept, then picking up interest in dev/ops would mean faring badly on acads in turn affecting cpi
(this problem is pretty real - when i took over navya, all the members then were from non-cs dept. and all of them had their degree extended)
but, they were all excellent hackers - most part of large foss group with commit rights

okay, i read through multiple posts. I think the main reason sds labs works out is due to their execution of ideas
they have very specific projects, which have high visiblity that probably motivates students to be part of the team that creates them
also, you are right about lack of continued participation in pclub, that has always been a problem

hackcave, was originally setup to prove that students can actually take a large project to completion in a professional way
but hackcave is yet to reach there, we have set a very high standard for ourselves

on the other hand, sds labs also seems like a mix of ecell + pclub to me
they have spin offs that can potentially be startup
our ecell on other hand is very conservative and secretive, which i totally hate (there is reasons for its operation to be that way.. but still.)
these thoughts aren't properly organized, but mostly just brain dump. may be all of us should talk about the objective of this dev group once irl

also this post - https://blog.sdslabs.co/2017/01/working-at-sdslabs-12 - captures the essence of their group
