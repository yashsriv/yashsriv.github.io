Its been 8 months since I started the interview process with FB and now that
I have some time on my hands, I'm writing about everything I did, how I got
the interview and the interviews themselves. Please keep in mind that I am
no expert and that there was some factor of luck involved in my selection,
and not everything I say here is 100% correct. Also do keep in mind that FB
and Palantir were the only off-campus placement opportunities I pursued, so
again I'm very inexperienced in these matters.

# Getting an Interview

In general, its possible to apply to any company from their online portal. FB
also has a nice portal where it autofills a lot of the data and then you need
to upload some more stuff and the application is done. Other companies, Google
etc., also have a similar system set up. But from what I know and what has been
told to me multiple times by my seniors, when someone applies through these
portals, the probability of their resume actually reaching a recruiter and then
the recruiter actually going through it is pretty slim (due to the huge number
of applications). Referrals are a sort of golden tickets which atleast ensure
that your resume reaches a recruiter. After that point, its the same for
everyone but even such a small helping hand goes a long way.

Having a referral still doesn't guarantee you an interview/position. Case in point -
I had a referral which I could use for any position at Google after completing
GSoC. I had used it an year earlier in the hopes of getting an internship in
the past summers.

# How I got the interview

Remember the part about luck being involved I mentioned above, instance #1 -
My friend was interning at Facebook's London Office in the summers and hence
he had 6 referrals he could use up. Fortunately, he chose to use one of the
referrals to refer me for a full time position as a Software Development
Engineer at Facebook's London Office. I sent him my resume ([this](/files/cv-fb.pdf)
was the exact resume I sent) and he wrote a short recommendation note and we
were good to go.

# Next Step

This mail was on the 1st of August which was followed by a follow up mail
on 6th asking about minor things like when I'll complete my graduation and
all. Once that was done, I was asked to provide a date and time when I'd
be free in the upcoming weeks and my final phone interview slot was set up
for August 28, 2:00 - 2:45 PM London Time.

I'll detail the phone interview in the [next part](/posts/fb-interview-2).
