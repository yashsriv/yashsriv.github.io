I have recently realised that over the past few years, I have learnt so many
new things and some things which I discover, forget and then rediscover again.
There is a huge knowledge bank in my head which is specific to me and things I
tried to explore. But the fact is, I learnt everything one day at a time. Those
days together have culminated into the knowledge bank I now possess.

Also, I don't usually get the time to write a lot of blog posts. So I have
decided to write short, [/r/todayilearned](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned)
type of posts whenever I discover something new. All such posts will be
listed at [til](/tags/til).
