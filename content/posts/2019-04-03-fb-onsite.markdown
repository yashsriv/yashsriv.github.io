This is my final post in my facebook interview series. This comes after:

* [Part 1](/posts/fb-interview-1)
* [Part 2](/posts/fb-interview-2)

My final on-site interviews were scheduled on the 9th October in the London Office
on something people at facebook call "University Day". Its mostly a day for
interviewing undergrads or people who have just finished their undergrad.

**Note: I'm not allowed to reveal the interview questions.**

# Preparation

From what I had read online, I knew that the Software Developer Role had 3
on-site interviews of 45 minutes each:

* Behavioural
* Algorithmic
* System Design

I hadn't prepared anything specific for the behavioural interview.

I spent the majority of the time preparing for the algorithmic interview as it is
by far my weakest point. I'm a developer who likes to develop things and I do have
knowledge of data structures and algorithms but I usually look them up when needed
and sometimes even solutions to simple algorithmic problems don't come easily to me.
(I practised from leetcode, hackerrank and Elements of Programming Interviews)

For the system design interview, I had taken a look at some sample problems online and
had decided that I would take a closer look at them at a later stage as they
seemed to be the kind of problems I enjoy solving and would be able to grasp the
idea easily.

Later on (I don't remember exactly when), I took a closer look at my interview
confirmation mail and got to know that since I'm an undergrad, instead of the system
design interview I would have another algorithmic interview (bummer!).

# On-Site

I reached the venue at the specified time and there were a total of 7 people who
were interviewing that day. There were people who were still doing their undergraduate (like me)
and others who had just finished in May and had recently joined some other company. We
were welcomed by the wonderful recruiting team and then after a few introductions, were
given a schedule of the interviews. I had the interviews in the following order:

* Behavioural
* Algorithmic 1
* Algorithmic 2

## Behavioural Interview

The initial 20-30 minutes were discussions on my past experience - stuff like explaining
any project I had done, my particular role, why I chose to explain that particular project
now, issues I might have faced while working under someone, while mentoring someone and so
on. Some examples of the type of questions asked are available at the following
[link](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/interview-questions-facebook-asks/).

After that, we had time for a simple algorithmic problem as well which I was supposed to
solve on a whiteboard. The problem was a pretty basic algorithm wrapped
up in a real world use-case and I was able to solve it quickly. First I verbally explained
my solution and then implemented it on the whiteboard.

## Algorithmic Interview 1
This was one of the interviews I think I messed up in. Usually in 45 minute interviews,
you have 2 problems which are usually solved in the timeframe and then if there is extra
time remaining, you get another question on which usually a discussion is just started.
I solved the first (easy) question and then got stuck on the 2nd one. Even when I managed
to solve it, the solution wasn't optimal. But, somehow, even though very little time was
left, I managed to atleast verbally/diagrammatically on the whiteboard, solve the last
one.

For the second question, I initially wasn't able to think of any solution and ended up
explaining the brute force solution (my fallback when I'm unable to think of anything).
Even after further discussions and hints from my interviewer, I arrived at a `O(nk)`
solution even though the optimal solution would be `O(n)`. I ultimately wrote this
non-optimal solution on the whiteboard.

The third question was a pretty nice question and I managed an optimal `O(n)` solution.
We ran out of time before I could write down the whole solution but I managed to
logically explain my idea.

## Algorithmic Interview 2

This third interview also went pretty well. We managed to finish 10 minutes before time.
After I solved each question, the interviewer asked what test cases would you pass to
make this program break and also while solving he asked me to do proper edge case handling
via `throw`s.

Once I was done with the questions (explaining idea + code), the question
was modified as a test of how well I had written my code to adjust for
modifications for a slightly different input and output.

For the 2nd question, I was stuck for some time but once I was given a hint - to think
on what algorithm I was mentally applying to achieve this series, I managed to solve
it and write a pretty elegant solution, if I might say so. My code was structured good
enough for me to make a single line change and add a `throw` at some spot to handle the
variant of the question asked to me.

## Post Interview

After the interviews, we were given an explaination of how the interviews were reviewed
and then we were taken on the tour of [the office](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2365658216796909)
(spoiler alert: its awesome!!) and that was it. The whole interview process was now done.

I was eventually contacted and informed that I would be extended a full-time offer at the
London Office. Right now, I have accepted the offer and am really looking forward to
joining there in August this year. Its going to be an amazing experience and I really
hope I'll learn a lot from it.
