There are times where people ask me about what software or config I am using and I like to share my config. This page will serve as a living document for my current setup.

This page is inspired from the following uses pages:

# Editor + Terminal
+ At Facebook, I use VSCode as the primary editor as that has a lot of
  integrations with the infra and it just works out-of-the-box. I use it with
  the VSCodeVIM plugin as I can't live without vim keybindings!
+ Personally, I use [Spacemacs] as my primary editor. I really like the unique
  mnemonic approach of vim keybindings applied to emacs which is the more
  powerful development environment (It just needs a good editor.. I'm kidding).
  + My config can be found [here](https://github.com/yashsriv/dotfiles/blob/master/spacemacs).
  + If you've never used it, I recommend trying out Magit. Its amazing.
  + Same for org-mode.
+ For lightweight editing purposes I still prefer vim and my minimal config for
  a good vim experience can be found [here](https://github.com/yashsriv/minimal-vim).
+ I use [st] with custom applied patches as my terminal on my arch linux pc.
  For my macbook, I prefer [iterm2].
+ I use Source Code Pro Semibold as my font of choice for all of my editors & terminals.
+ For my shell, I use zsh with [prezto].

# Apps
+ [Bitwarden] is my password manager of choice.
+ I am heavily dependent on [AwesomeWM] as my window manager on my linux PC.
