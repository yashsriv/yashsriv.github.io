Hey there, I am Yash. I am ~~not~~ a geek who is interested in
anything related to computers or science fiction.

After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to gain
admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and
completed my B.Tech in the Computer Science and Engineering
Department. I'm currently very excited to join at FB London on 5th
August, 2019.

I tend to waste my time reading books, watching movies + tv series,
playing video games, hanging out with friends and enjoying life in
general.
