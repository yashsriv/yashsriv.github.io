Hey there, I am Yash. I am ~~not~~ a geek who is interested in anything related to computers or science fiction.

After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to gain admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur
where I'm pursuing an Undergratuate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department.

I tend to waste my time reading books, watching movies, playing games, hanging out with friends and enjoying life in general.
