 Today I gave up on the sentence anagram assignment... I managed all the functions except the last
 one which actually solves the sentence anagrams. I got the algorithm but the `List[List[List[String]]]` were
 getting out of hand, and I was wasting too much time on it so I left it as a good challenge for later on when I
 have some time on my hands. :disappointed: 

  After that I started twitter's scala school which explains how they use scala in their framework.
 I am having a little difficulty understanding covariance and stuff but I will probably get a feel
 for it once I program something using that. Currently I am reading about `Finagle`. Also I noticed that they haven't
mentioned scala Actors API which I see mentioned everywhere involving a concurrent framework.
