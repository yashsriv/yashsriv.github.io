  The past two days, I have spent wrapping my head about the `akka` library.
Even the example starting assignments are a little involved and require
lightbend activator. I failed miserably at my attempts at installing lightbend
and now have given up, instead, reading from the online tutorials.

  I spent a good amount of time understanding actors, concurrency et al.
I have finally understood the Akka Actors API thanks to a
[ping pong example](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/scala-akka-actors-ping-pong-simple-example)
by Alvin Alexander(the author of `Scala Cookbook`) and now will proceed
further with `akka-streams` and `akka-http`.
